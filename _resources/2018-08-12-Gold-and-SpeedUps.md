As many of these tips, how you choose to leverage your resources is a personal preference. For many of the players here, the following basic guidelines help to maximize
both power and building growth.

### Gold
Gold is the linchpin resource that will help get you passed "the growth hump". As you grow in levels, it becomes more difficult to gather resources to sustain that growth. Your troops will consume your food, you will NEVER be able to find enough shackles, horns, or tinder to support building growth over level 24 unless you eat, sleep, and s**t this game for the next few years daily, and yes; you will eventually forget to update your shield and will have all your tasty resources stolen. Nom-nom-nom.

Gold is not automatically produced like other resources. You can either spend real money (gets expensive FAST) or obtain it via these methods:
- Raid events: These are team events that change daily. Working as a team to obtain a higher overall completion level award greater gold. These are initiated by Netmarble/Iron Throne.
- Daily events: These are the Solo, Inferno, and Alliance events you see popup on your castle screen. The higher level you complete, the more gold awarded. These will be comprised of different tasks like building troops, researching, PvP battles, etc.
- Tutorial missions and tasks: Goals throughout the game that award resources such as completing buildings and all the beginning tutorial mode tasks.
- Chronicles: These are awarded when certain goals have been achieved through normal game play. Things like raising your castle, lord, or hero to a new level. These will be automatically awarded when you complete them. You can view them in the Chronicles screen.
- Daily free award: The shop has a free package EVERY DAY! Get it.

You can then use the gold to speed up many tasks like immediately constructing a building or immediately completing research. You can obviously also use it to buy speed-ups and other items in the store. (insert segue here)

### Speed Ups
There are different types of speed ups each of which have a different function:
- General: may be used to speed up anything.
- Construction: used only for speeding up construction.
- Research: used only for speeding up research.
- Healing: used only for speeding up healing.

Construction, research, and healing are self explanatory and single use. The best place to obtain these is in town mode doing the daily tasks. Do them all; every day. The only additional comment on these three might be to not completely heal all your troops at one time with the healing speed up. You will have a daily task to heal 1,000 troops and this is an easy one to finish up with low level troops and costs nothing. Save some healing for this task.

The general speed ups are a bit more flexible. Many here have found that using these for research yields the best results. Research is what gives you the attack/defend power than does not go down when you lose troops. It also buffs up your resource creation and gathering, assists with hunting and marching speeds, aides in rallies, etc. Using speed-ups to build troops is not recommended. They are gonna die, it's a fact, but they can always be replaced. A solid recommendation for using generic speed-ups is:
- 80% research
- 10% building (especially when you get up around 23/24)
- 10% crafting (gear is the meat and potatoes of hero success)

In summary, there are many different ways to use your gold and your speed ups. Play the game, get the gold, and burn through the speed ups to grow, grow grow!
