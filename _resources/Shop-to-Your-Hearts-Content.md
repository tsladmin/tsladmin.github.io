There are three ways to obtain materials, resources, etc. without spending actual money.

#### The Merchant:

Located in the middle of Town Mode, this little dude has deals to go around! You should visit the merchant *every day* to purchase items using resources. In addition,  you will also be completing a daily quest with 5 purchases. Buy whatever you need that is available for purchase with resources. You can use gold to refresh the selection and some of the smaller cost gold items are a bargain as well. Be sure to purchase at least 5 things for quest credit. You will NOT find gold purchases cheaper anywhere if you do decide to spend gold.

#### The Alliance Shop:

Ever wonder what the heck those honor points are that you keep getting awarded? Enter the Alliance Shop. In here you can spend your honor points on many different items that are added to the store. The R4's and R5 members can add items from the catalog into the Alliance Store using Alliance Points (these are like honor points for the Alliance) and then you can use your points to purchase these items.

#### The VIP Shop:

This little gem is located by selecting the VIP icon in the upper-left hand corner and then selecting the **VIP Shop** tab. The items you can purchase here are determine based upon you VIP level. What is cool about the VIP shop is that you can purchase items here that are not available anywhere else such as resurrecting your favorite hero that just got executed. Lifesaver!



So no matter where you get your stuff, just remember that it doesn't always have to be from the "real money" store and there are other options available.
