Properly selecting and upgrading your gear (primary and secondary  weapons, accessories, armor and helmet) at a critical factor in  dramatically increasing your power.

1. Pay attention to the gear sets. A hero with a complete set of gear is  substantially more powerful that a hero with a “mix-matched” set. Review the different gear sets and plan the appropriate set to match your  hero’s strengths. Review the descriptions on the sets to help match set  strengths with your hero.
2. Always obtain materials to upgrade your gear. Upgrading gear is critical to reaching the full potential of the gear set. You should always  strive to have your gear at Epic if not Immortal levels. Monster hunts  are the trick to finding material. Pay attention to the names of the  monsters as you get higher in level as they will correlate with the type of gear (e.g. Dominator Lamia, etc.). Immortal gear is difficult when  you hit the level 30 sets but upgrade each item when you can; do not  wait until you have enough material to upgrade the complete set.  Incremental upgrades return great benefits in hero performance.
3. Enhancing gear is a more laborious process. It requires Craft Research  to be completed and in addition requires two pieces of gear at the same  level in order to enhance the target. For example: an Immortal level  helmet would take TWO Immortal helmets to enhance to a +1 status.
