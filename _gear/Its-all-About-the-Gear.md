Starting with the second (or maybe third) update to Iron Thrones, gear began playing a much larger role in your power. Equipping and maximizing an item's potential with give your hero the edge in not just PvP battles, but dimensional and Story Mode battles as well.

Each item set has a specific purpose which you should review and map to your hero's trait (infantry, archer, gathering, production, etc.) and/or appointment (scholar, architect, guard captain, or treasurer). There are some sets that are generic like the Berserker while others like the Sagacious are specific to an appointment. Learn which set works with hero specifics and assign them accordingly; it makes a HUGE difference in power and hero combat power.

Do not waste resources or upgrade items on lower level equipment to raise it. For example, do not waste resources trying to raise a Common level Berserker sword to Immortal; it is easier *and cheaper* to simply craft a new Berserker sword as chances are you will craft a higher level such as Rare. From there you can proceed to move up the path to Immortal

<dd>While matching a set definitely increases your overall power, it does not always correlate to a beneficial power boost for your hero. There are some instances where it will be stronger for your hero to use a mix of different item types to be stronger. For example: Conqueror sword with a Dominator helmet and Destroyer armor. It may make sense to keep a set or two on standby and re-equip your hero based on what you want to do such as hunting monsters vs. PvP.</dd>

There are many different ways to collect materials to upgrade your gear. Town Mode will provide Berserker material as will Black Unicorns. Most of the other set materials can be obtained fighting monsters with the same name as the item set (as also mentioned [here](https://titanslegion.com/gear/suit-up-your-gear/)). The Kingdom Monster Raids that occur once per week have the chance of dropping relic gear which results in a significant power boost.

As also mentioned earlier, gear enhancement is possible (after you unlock *Unlock Equipment Grade* and *Increase Enhancement Level* research branches) for some but not all equipment. This can only be done to Immortal equipment and requires an identical piece of equipment also upgraded to Immortal level. The level of enhancement is directly related to the *Increase Enhancement Level* research stat. The higher the stat, the greater the effect of the enhancement.
