Town Mode &#8594; AP &#8594; Chaotic Strongholds &#8594; Inn Cards &#8594; Speed Ups, horns, tinder, and shackles.

This cycle is the key to faster growth because of the 3 day and 7 day speed ups you get from the Inn along with other buffs. Disrupt any part of the cycle can hamper your growth.

Tip regarding Town Mode: Yes, we all hate going through Town Mode. Why the hell can't Crook keep up with his potatoes and get those soldiers with the cold hand some gloves for crying out loud! A quick time saver getting through this is to use silver to complete the tasks. If you don't have enough or need to save it, tap on the name of the current task twice to run faster. Before you start the quests, check the "Daily Boosts" in the upper left-hand corner. There are three buffs that will be applied when you complete tasks 2, 5, and 10. Determine what buffs you will need that day (Resource Growth, Troop Attacks, Research, etc.) and change each of the boots until they satisfy your goals for that day. This is worth spending some silver to obtain the proper buffs.

Chaotic Strongholds are where you will net most of your resources. If you completely destroy the stronghold you will obtain coins to be used at the Inn and usually a couple other smaller items.

Play the cards at the Inn every day. This is an excellent way to obtain long term speed ups and large resource boosts.
