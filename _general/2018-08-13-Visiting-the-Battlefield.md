The battlefield is one of the many ways you can obtain gold and resources and becomes available at level 5. To start, go to **Battlefield** using the icon on the right-hand side of the screen.

Next, select the **Story** tile on the left.

When you initially complete all sections you will receive a pretty solid gold reward. It's been a while since most of us were there but the consensus seems to be around 20,000. After you complete all 9 sections, you can then begin them again in "challenge mode". Try to get all 3 starts in each challenge for the biggest rewards.

<dd>If you are having trouble completing a section in challenge mode, try suiting up your hero with better gear or upgrading existing gear. You can also change out heroes based on their trait (a Scholar will not fight as well as a Guard Captain or Archer). Finally, you may also just be at the cap or your current skill level and need to wait until you are stronger and come back.</dd>

After you have completed challenge mode, you can then come back *every day* and pay a little silver to complete each section again to obtain rewards such as horns, shackles, and tinder. You are definitely going to need these later so this daily ritual will add up and you will be glad when you are trying to upgrade to a level 24 prison for example.
