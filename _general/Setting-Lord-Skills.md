Your Lord’s Skill Presets are a HUGE time saver for maximizing growth in research/production as well as battle/raids. Swapping preset profiles  is completed as follows:

1. Click on the image of your Lord in the upper left of the screen.
2. Click the Lord Skills button in the upper right of the screen.

There are four slots that can be used for different presets. It is highly recommended to set the first two as follows:

1. Economy  focused: Only assign points to the Economy skills leaving Battle empty.  This will dramatically shorten the time to research new skills,  build/upgrade buildings, and train troops. This should be the default  settings when not hunting monsters or engaging in PvP.
2. Battle  focused: Do the opposite here; assign all points to Battle leaving  Economy empty. This preset maximizes your hero’s attacks against  monsters and also your troop attacks against strongholds. This will also  speed the increase of AP which is useful prior to the Alliance Monster  hunt or PvP hunting events.

The third and fourth presets can be set as a personal preference  creating a different blend of skills. A wide variety of skill presets  are key to successful gaming in and out of battle. You can purchase  preset changes through the merchant with gold when they appear,  otherwise it is 1,000 gold per preset change.
